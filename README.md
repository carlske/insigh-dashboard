| Category       | Description                                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Colors**     | Neutral and brand palette (Roman Coffee, Foggy Gray, Big Stone) |
| **Typography** | Font sizes, weights, and line-heights                           |
| **Spacing**    | Consistent padding and margins                                  |
| **Radius**     | Rounded shapes for modern UIs                                   |

## üß† Architecture Notes

The design system follows **a modular structure** intended to be published as a standalone NPM package.  
For now, it lives within the frontend workspace, but it‚Äôs prepared to be extracted into `/packages/design-system` in a monorepo setup.

---

## üß™ Testing

```bash
pnpm test
```

Unit tests can be implemented using **Vitest** or **Jest** for component validation.

---

## üì¶ Build and Distribution

To export as a library package:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Then link or publish it to your NPM registry for reuse across projects.

---

## üß≠ Vision

> **Insigh UI** aims to bridge design and development, providing a strong visual identity and scalable UI foundation for future projects.
